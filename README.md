# Data Science Project - Sensor Data Preparation
### Problem Statement

Vibranium is a very valuable element (at least in the Marvel universe).  A leading Vibranium producing country has recently discovered that it can effectively "mine" Vibrainium atoms from air.  One of the most skilled mining engineers has built prototype sensors for detecting Vibranium concentrations.

The engineer has asked you to produce a predictor of Vibranium concentration (number of Vibranium atoms per billion air atoms) based upon air temperature in Celsius using preliminary data she has collected.

Unfortunately, the sensors are prototypes.  As a result, the sensors are sometimes faulty.  You will have to adapt to the faulty data.  The sensor engineer, who clearly has significant domain expertise, will provide some guidance on dealing with sensor challenges.
